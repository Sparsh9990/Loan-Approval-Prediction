# Loan-Approval-Prediction
Loaded a small dataset (615 values) from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication) to pandas dataframe. I then found various statistical measures about the data to gain more insight. Then to clean the data any missing values were removed and label encoding (Converting alphabetical info of the categorical data into numerical values) was done as part of pre-processing. Data visualisation was performed on the remaining clean data and the insights gained were that people who have graduated have a higher chance of loan approval. Also married people have a higher chance of loan approval. Then I used the **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model** and loaded/trained the classifier with training and test set. As a result the accuracy scores were 79.8% and 83.3% respectively.
